# Obstacle-avoiding-Robot-
This Robot is built to detect any metal pieces and move away from it , with the intention that a landmine is being avoided 
We worked on Designing and Developing An Automated Landmine detection Rover.
We did a thorough study on robotics and gathered our knowledge on topics like actuators, mechatronics and basic algorithms. We researched on landmines, their types and what are the techniques used in past and recent times to detect landmines.
We went to different stores in Bengaluru and bought parts like motors, robotic frame, sensors and microprocessors.
As Electronics Engineering students, we automated the robot by using ultrasonic sensor and programming it in such a way that the robot turned when it detected an obstacle.
This project was a boon for me as I learned a lot about developing and designing a robot from scratch. Continuous tests and experiments helped me get a strong hold on the concepts of robotics and automation.
